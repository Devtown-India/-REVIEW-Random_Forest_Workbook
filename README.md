# Random_Forest_Workbook

I'm trying to implement the Random Forest algorithm for Classification and Regression problems, both from scratch and by using the already available sklearn packages in python.

## Aug 6
Tried to understand how Decision trees work.<br />Books:<br /> Hand-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow & Data Science from Scratch by Joel Grus.

## Aug 8
Tried to understand concepts like Gini index, entropy information gain and pruning of Decision trees.

## Aug 9
Understood what Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) is and how that along with feature randomness is used to implement Random forest algorithms.
